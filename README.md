# Sentinel Functions Library

Welcome to the **Sentinel Functions Library**, a collection of utilities and helper classes for various system programming tasks.

## Overview

This library provides:

- **ThreadPool**: A robust C++11+ thread pool implementation.
- [Other utilities/components that your project includes, if any]

## Contents

```
SentinelFunctions/
├── concurrency/
│ └── ThreadPool.h
├── README.md
└── ...
```

- **`concurrency/ThreadPool.h`**: Contains the `ThreadPool` class, which manages a pool of worker threads.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone** or **download** the repository:
  
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/SentinelFunctions.git
  ```
  
2. **Include** the header in your project:
  

  
  ```
  #include "SentinelFunctions/concurrency/ThreadPool.h"
```
  
3. **Link** with any required libraries (if any). The `ThreadPool` class only relies on the standard C++ library and requires no additional dependencies.
  
4. **Use** the class in your code:
  

  
  ```
  #include <iostream>
  #include "SentinelFunctions/concurrency/ThreadPool.h"
  
  int main() {
   // Create a thread pool with 4 threads
   ThreadPool pool(4);
   // Enqueue a simple task
   auto result = pool.enqueue([] {
  
  
     std::cout << "Hello from the thread pool!\n";
     return 42;
  
  
  });
   // Retrieve the result
   std::cout << "The answer is: " << result.get() << std::endl;
   return 0;
  }
  ```
  

## Features

- **Task Queue**  
  Dynamically enqueue tasks (lambdas or function objects) to be executed by the worker threads.
  
- **Thread Safe**  
  The class internally manages access to shared data with mutexes and condition variables.
  
- **Easy Integration**  
  Simply include `ThreadPool.h` in your project. No external dependencies required.
  
- **Result Retrieval**  
  Leverages `std::future` for convenient result handling and synchronization.
